## Documentation
**_Install Instructions_**

You first need to have python installed. If you don't, [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) it here. Next, download this [zipped](https://github.com/circuit-specialists/Power-Suply-and-Electronic-Load-Control/archive/master.zip) repo. Once you have the repo, unzip the repo to a folder run `pip install -r requirements.txt` from the command line to install the dependencies. Once finish you can run the main.py.

**_Program Usage_**

* There are two modes. 
    * The GUI version is current as of v1.3 alpha.
        * To run the GUI version, run `python gui.py`.
    * The command line version is current as of v1.2.
        * To run the command line version, run `python cmd.py`.

###### GUI Help
To access the GUI help, run the GUI and select the help menu item.

###### Command Line Help
When the program first runs, the option for either running a power supply or electronic load is given. Once the type of device is selected, the type of run usage also needs to be selected. 

If you choose `Auto Mode`, you'll need to have a .csv file titled `auto_run_el.csv` for electronic loads, or `auto_run_ps.csv` for power supplies. The format for each type is diplayed in the first line of the provided example files.

If you chose `Manual Mode`, the program will prompt for the input values. Make sure to give full values, such as 0.123, 1, or 1.123. The program very likely will not be able to interpret truncated values such as .123.

**_Device Additions_**

More devices, and types of devices will be added on at later dates. To add a device yourself, place the device definitions and functions following the current structure as seen in "/Power Supplies/*.py", or "Electronic Loads/*.py" in the Power Supplies folder, then add the import/instantiation into powersupply.py or electronicload.py, whichever type of device you are adding along with the specs neccesary to interact with device.
